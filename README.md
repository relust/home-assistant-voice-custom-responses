# home-assistant-voice-custom-responses
# Introduction

Ever since the new official [Home Assistant Voice satellite ](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/) was launched to be used with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), I wanted to try to make the conversation as natural as possible through this satellite..
Through this project, custom random responses can be added to the Home Assistant Voice PE satellite instead of the wake sound.
